This is our new weekly raffle. It’s a bit different than the typical 50/50 raffle you see in most guilds. You don’t earn raffle tickets by donating gold to the guild bank.

## Earning raffle tickets

Instead of depositing gold in the guild bank to get raffle tickets they are earned by grouping up with guild mates and killing together.

Every day you can earn 1 raffle ticket per dungeon or battlegrounds (BG) that you do with a member of the guild for a maximum of 3 tickets. Guild events and trials count 1 additional bonus ticket each.

> 1 undaunted quest + 1 random dungeon + 1 random battlegrounds = 3 tickets

> 2 random dungeons + 1 battlegrounds + 1 trial + 1 event = 5 tickets

When you complete an event submit the dungeons or battlegrounds you completed to the `#battle-log` on discord.

**Example:**

This would earn both people 2 tickets for that day. If you want to post several throughout the day that’s ok. This is purely based on the honor system so please don’t abuse this opportunity.

## Eligibility

Everyone is eligible in the guild except for the guild leaders Miagee and DeepDragon8. However, you can still group up with them to earn tickets. Discord access is required by one of the members of the group to post.

## Drawing

Every week on Wednesday, Mr. Miagee will post on Discord at 8:30PM when the drawing will begin. The winner will be announced in the message of the day and items mailed promptly afterwards.

## Rewards

The rewards will cycle between gold and non-gold rewards like mats, armor, weapons, furnishings, and style pages. If you’d like to donate items for any future rewards send them to Miagee with “Raffle Reward Donation” as the subject.
