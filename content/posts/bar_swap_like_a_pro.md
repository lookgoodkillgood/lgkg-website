When you play Elder Scrolls Online and turn level 15, the game introduces the "bar swap" mechanic. The bar swap mechanic is how you switch back and forth between your primary and backup skills. By default, you do this by hitting the left directional button on the PS4 controller.

This bar swap mechanic for me quickly became a pain as I tried to improve my DPS numbers. It wasn't a big deal when I first started learning the game and adventuring casually. However, it became a hindrance when I was involved in prolonged fights in veteran dungeons or trials. My left hand would ache because of the drastic movement required to move my thumb from the left stick to the left directional hundreds of times.

To remedy this issue, I started looking into the in-game options to see if I could re-map my controller buttons. Unfortunately, on the console version of the game, this functionality doesn't exist. The inability to customize controls has been a common gripe of mine since converting to console gaming from PC many years ago. To find the solution, I would have to either re-wire my controller or hope it existed on the PS4 software.

Thanks to Google and piecing information from several sites, I found a solution using the native **Accessibility** features on the PS4. You can re-map any of the controller buttons from the **Settings** menu.

My choice was to switch the left directional button with the R3 button. This was a game changer. I no longer needed to lift my finger to swap my bars. Essentially, I was swapping the sneak button with the bar swap button. While this was my decision you can choose any combination of buttons to your liking.

## How to re-bind bar swapping to the R3 button

### 1. Go to the Settings menu and select the Accessibility option.

## Closing Remarks

I'd be surprised if making this change to your controller doesn't only help your hand not get destroyed, but improves your DPS and game experience.
