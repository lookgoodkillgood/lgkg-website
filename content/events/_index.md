## Recurring events

> **All events are 1 to 1.5 hours. We start grouping at 8:30PM CT**

- **Motif Mondays** -- We go to a zone and complete dailies together. Several zones have a delve daily and a world boss daily. In Western Skyrim and The Reach you can also do a Harrow-storm daily. After we complete the dailies we turn them in so someone else can get the quests and share them again with the group. We do this several times and this is known as "motif farming." These dailies provide gear and sought after style pages.

- **Workshop Wednesdays** -- We cover topics that help people improve their characters in the game. In our DPS workshop we cover light attack weaving, animation canceling, passives, gear, etc. We have other workshops planned like making gold, CP 2.0, and more!

- **Furniture Friday Swap Meet** --  1st and 3rd Friday of the month. A place to sell, trade, or talk about all things related to furnishing. We have people who share designs that can be learned by your crafter or craft furniture for others. This is a great way for those that enjoy furnishing to socialize.

- **Friday Night Fights** -- Every Friday night we venture out in battle! We either go to Cyrodiil or Imperial City and smash on Blue and Yellow.

- **"Vet Sweat" Saturday** -- This is the equivalent of a "dungeon achievement night" and doesn't have to be veteran dungeons either. The event is mainly to encourage members to group up and complete dungeon achievements. That could be a speed run or no death run through a dungeon on normal or veteran.

- **Skyshard Sunday** -- We group up and hunt down all the skyshards for a zone.
