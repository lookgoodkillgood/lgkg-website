## Mission

LGKG is a **member-centric** guild dedicated to improving the ESO game experience for **new and veteran players**. We are a balanced social guild that combines the pursuit of endgame accomplishments with a casual flair. We aim to be **THE** place you can trust to find a competent group.

## Culture

> Ultimately, You should get back from the guild what you decide to put into it, not the other way around.

The guild was created to address problems often experienced in ESO guilds and the game in general.

- Distant guild leaders and officers.
- Getting "lost" in larger guilds.
- Toxic players.
- Elitism and inner circles.

We address the above by constantly focusing on what members in the guild are trying to accomplish and keeping the core membership small (quality over quantity). The hardest part of finding the right guild is becoming an established member. This is one of our strengths. Simply jump into voice chat or text chat and ask if anyone wants to join you. The expectation is that everyone should be comfortable responding to `lfg` requests. **Ultimately, You should get back from the guild what you decide to put into it, not the other way around.**

## Requirements

- +18 years or older
- Active by joining others in their adventures
- Able to communicate via text or voice
- Enjoy talking about builds and collecting motifs
- Grit (don't easily give up on hard content)
- Able to take a joke or two
