## Mission

LGKG is a **member-centric** guild dedicated to improving the ESO game experience for **new and veteran players**. We are a balanced social guild that combines the pursuit of endgame accomplishments with a casual flair. We aim to be **THE** place you can trust to find a competent group.

## Culture

The guild was created to address problems often experienced in ESO guilds and the game in general.

- ⏳ Long queue times
- Finding people who want to run similar content
- 🥳 Making friends
- Getting "lost" in larger guilds
- 👿 Toxic players

We address the above by constantly focusing on what members in the guild are trying to accomplish and keeping  membership small (💎 quality over quantity). The guild leaders are expected to group with everyone. The hardest part of finding the right guild is becoming an established member. This is one of our strengths 💪. Simply jump into voice chat and introduce yourself. Give us a chance, you'll feel right at home in no time 🏠. The expectation is that everyone should be comfortable responding to "looking for group" requests. **Ultimately, You should get back from the guild what you decide to put into it, not the other way around.**
